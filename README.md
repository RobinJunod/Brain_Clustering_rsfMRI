# MYSPACE lab Parcellation of the brain using fmri resting state
KEYPOINTS : fmri analysis, single subject, parcellation, resting state

## Similarity matrix computation
Similarity map generated based on a Congrad github. Pearson coorelation of the voxels fingerprints within a ROI
## Spatial Gradient magnitude map
These map is created by looking at the neighbours of each voxel and comparing their similarity maps.
